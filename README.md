# cForAll Library

The cForAll class in this library should be used as replacement of the procedural version of the For_All command. The advantage of cForAll is that it is true object oriented coded and that filters can be created on the fly. cForAll supports data dictionaries but does not depend or require them. Data dictionaries are the preferred way to handle data in DataFlex.
